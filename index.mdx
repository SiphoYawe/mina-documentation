# Mina SDK

The Mina SDK is a TypeScript-first cross-chain bridge SDK that enables seamless bridging of assets from over 40 blockchain networks directly to Hyperliquid. With built-in auto-deposit functionality, bridged USDC is automatically deposited to your trading account on Hyperliquid L1.

## Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="40+ Supported Chains" icon="link">
    Bridge from Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, and many more chains to HyperEVM.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-Deposit to L1" icon="arrow-right-to-arc">
    Bridged USDC is automatically detected and deposited to your Hyperliquid L1 trading account.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Route Optimization" icon="route">
    Intelligent routing finds the best bridge path based on speed, cost, or a balanced recommendation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="React Integration" icon="react">
    First-class React support with hooks for quotes, balances, and transaction status tracking.

## How It Works

The Mina SDK simplifies the complex process of cross-chain bridging and depositing to Hyperliquid into a single, streamlined flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Quote">
    Request a bridge quote specifying source chain, destination (HyperEVM), tokens, and amount. The SDK finds optimal routes across integrated bridge protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve Tokens">
    If needed, the SDK prompts for token approval. This is a one-time operation per token per chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Bridge">
    Sign and submit the bridge transaction. The SDK handles all the complexity of cross-chain messaging.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detect USDC Arrival">
    The SDK monitors HyperEVM for your USDC arrival, polling the balance until the bridge completes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-Deposit to L1">
    Once USDC arrives on HyperEVM, the SDK automatically approves and executes the deposit to Hyperliquid L1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    The SDK confirms the deposit is reflected in your Hyperliquid L1 trading balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>
